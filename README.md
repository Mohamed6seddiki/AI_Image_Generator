# 🧠 AI Interface Project

This project is a collection of interactive web pages designed to demonstrate tools related to artificial intelligence, image editing, and digital identity. It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and visual assets, organized into different functional pages.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `AI.html` – An AI-powered image generation interface.
- `IMGEditor.html` – A basic image editor interface.
- `PP.html` – A personal profile or digital portfolio page.
- `ka.html` – An additional demo/test page.
- `.css` files – Used for styling each HTML page individually.
- `.js` files – Scripts to add interactivity and functionality.
- `package.json` – Contains project metadata and npm dependencies.
- `assets/` – A collection of images used across the site (e.g. profile images, icons).

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Open in Browser

You can simply open any of the `.html` files directly in your web browser:

```bash
# Example:
double-click PP.html
```

### Option 2: Using Node.js (optional, if dependencies exist)

```bash
npm install
npm start  # Only if a start script is defined
```

> Note: `package.json` is included, so this option is available if the project uses packages like express, live-server, etc.

## 🖼️ Visual Assets

The project includes multiple images such as:

- `ANIS1.jpg`, `imgedirot.jpg` – For design/demo purposes
- `facebook.png`, `instagram.png`, `gmail.png` – Social media icons

Make sure these images stay in the same directory to avoid broken links in the web pages.
